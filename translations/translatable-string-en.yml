# NOTE: Tranlsators, ignore the rest of this comment, it is for developers only

# This get a bit complicated, as we can support languages in the app that the OS's don't support
# As long as the alphabet is supported it'll work
# However, we won't be able to automatically select the language, and will instead default to what their phone has
# The default fall back is English.
#
# Apple and Android don't perfectly overlap on this and the list of supported languages changes from version to version
# A gneral list cand be found here:
